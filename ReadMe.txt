MAZETHONDUINO

GAME CONTROL USING UNITY,ARDUINO AND SENSORS

# In this project I have first created a simple game using UNITY where our character is a robot shooting the sphere obstracles. The aim is to
keep on increasing the score and exploring the maze.

# I used the joystick module to take vertical and horizontal input along with third joystick button for shooting.

# Unity reads the input from the system port and processes it according to the scripts.

# There is also a laser module and buzzer which are activated as soon as you start firing. It gives a really cool effect while playing.

# The 7 segment display acts as a bullet counter.

# Due to the nature of the bits transfered from the arduino to the pc the game runs really slowly. But still it is fun to play.
